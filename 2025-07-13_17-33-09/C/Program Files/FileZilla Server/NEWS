+ MSW: fixed regression causing socket listener conflicts due to recent libfilezilla changes.
+ Added WebUI: an HTTP server providing a REST API and a web app for seamless web access to stored files. WebUI is not included in the default build and must be enabled with the --enable-webui parameter during compilation. This feature is experimental; feedback and bug reports are welcome.

+ Fixed bug that led to timeouts not being set at startup, but only when changing the configuration.
- FTP Server: NLST would report a file names with a leading ./ path in certain cases, which confused some clients. Fixed.

In case of pre-existing conflicts in the configuration file, the administration listeners take precedence, so that it is still possible to change the FileZilla Server's configuration.

This is to workaround the issue that when doing a Windows Update the settings could be wiped out. Settings still residing under %LOCALAPPDATA%\filezilla-server are automatically migrated.

- Admin UI: made default connection values correct, in case the settings file is missing.
- MSW: fixed various bug in the ExecDos plugin, that could cause the admin password not to be set properly.

1.4.0-rc1 (2022-04-20)

! MSW: the installer doesn't rely on the PATH environment variable to find the tools it needs, but refers to them absolutely, to avoid hijacking.
+ The size of the TCP buffer sizes on the sockets used for data transfers can now be specified
+ Configuration files are now tagged with a "flavour" and a version number. The Server will refuse to load configuration files with a different flavour than its own or with a version higher than its own. The server's option --config-version-check can be used to control this functionality: if specified, the server checks the versioning, performs the required action and then exit, unless its action is 'ignore'. If the action is 'error', it just checks whether the versions are ok. If the action is 'backup', then a backup of the files is made if the versions are not ok. The parameter --config-version-check-result-file is used to specify a file in which the result of the version check has to be put. If the file contains 'ok', then everything went file. If the file contains 'error', then there was an error. If the file contains 'backup', then a backup was made. The installer makes use of this functionality.
+ Admin UI: the selected log entries can now be copied to the clipboard, in CSV, HTML and plaintext formats through the context menu
+ Admin UI: the settings dialog layout has been changed to accomodate for future other protocol settings, factoring out the settings that are common to all protocols.
+ Admin UI: adjusted borders and spacing to look better on HiDPI displays.
+ Admin UI: preserve the fingerprints of the previously connected servers. The connection dialog gives hints when inputing the host and port.
+ Log files can optionally be rotated daily instead of by size
+ Added option to specify a default user to impersonate if a user logs in with an account that does not use impersonation

+ MSW: users are now case-insensitive
